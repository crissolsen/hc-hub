description: Coding is being introduced as a compulsory subject in many schools. In this series we look at why that is great news. To start off, let's look at the skill of decomposition.

## Think Like a Computer
You're not alone in saying that we don't want our kids to just be computers who just get repeat facts and process information without emotion or humanity. We all know that we're not just moist robots. There's much more to being a human.

So should we teach our kids to think like computers? 

No.

> We should teach our children use computers and tech to solve problems that aren't even around yet.

## Computational Thinking
When we talk about computational thinking and how excellent it is for education, we're not saying our kids should be computers. Using a computer and coding to solve problems teaches problem solving better than pretty much anything else. Let's look at the yukkiest sounding one first...

## Decomposition of a Big Stinky Tree
If you've been reading the blog for a while, you'll know that I love [using analogies to make thinking visible](/blog/see-understanding-analogies). Let's use one here. I live near many beautiful forests. Trees fall down all the time in these forests (and yes, they make a noise even if no one is there to hear it). When you pass a tree that's fallen and is decomposing you'll see it isn't a quick process and it doesn't do it by itself.

Trees taken apart piece by piece by a team of decomposers who aren't scared of its size. They know they just has a small part to deal with and they'll get onto the rest at a later stage. That's how we want our kids to solve problems!

> We want our children to be able to take a massive problem and see how they can work out the smaller pieces (with others), solving those and seeing how they don't need to be afraid of a big task.

I remember one learner, specifically, who wouldn't look at a problem solving question (in any of the subjects I taught him) and he would give up quickly, saying, "I don't get it." I'd ask him what part he doesn't get and he'd repeat his answer, adding, "Any of it..."

We'd go through it word by word. I showed him that he understands all the words and if he takes it one word and one sentence at a time he did get it.

I loved hearing him say, "Oh! I get it."

## Coding Fosters Decomposition
Make a game.

Now.

Too much, right? You need to know more. When you better understand the problem you are able to start breaking it apart into smaller pieces. 

Like character movement. Sound design. Colours and backgrounds. 

And you only need to work on one at a time. That's doable!

Take a look at this video to see it in action.
