## It's a process
Learning and problem solving are not just about knowing that there are different types of thinking.

> Our children need to know how to select the best type of thinking for any given situation.

That's what Blue Hat thinking is all about. Selecting the process and deciding which thinking would be best for any goal that needs to be achieved.

## Challenge them
I would continually fall into the trap of dictating how learners should engage in a problem. Rather give them the option and have them describe why they would use a certain kind of thinking (even if they're just doing so verbally).

Remember to check out the fun and practical activities that accompany these posts :)
