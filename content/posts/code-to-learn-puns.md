## Got something to scratch?
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), in case you haven't heard yet, is an outstanding tool for practically learning to code. You don't get caught in the syntax and can easily create with blockly.

## Why puns?
As an English teacher the lessons where we focused on puns, playing on words and jokes were incredibly enjoyable. It helped learners delve into the meaning of words and how to use words to express themselves in different ways. 

> Seeing humour in situations is also a habit of the mind of successful people.
