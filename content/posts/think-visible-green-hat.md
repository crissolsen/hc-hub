## Where'd all the bad ideas go?
You know when we, as adults, stopped learning as effectively as children? When we become afraid of sounding silly. 

> It's only when you're vulnerable and brave that you really learn.

That's where the green thinking hat comes in.

## A place for creativity
Remember that thinking hats are just a tool for thinking skills. There are many ways to provoke creative thinking and this is just one of them. The important thing here is that we do provoke thinking!

We need to create space and a place for being creative, coming up with wild and ridiculous ideas that are self-censored or censored by others.

That's how some of the most amazing things have been engineered, drawn, written, composed and learnt.

Remember to check out the link below for some excellent activities to provoke creativity and help our children see that they can be creative!
