## iPhone, iRobot and iMcDonalds?
McDonalds is not as good as Burger King. I said it. Now that's out of the way let's talk about how McDonalds have replaced humans.

The last time I ordered from McDonalds I used [a touch screen](https://www.sciencealert.com/no-mcdonald-s-touch-screens-are-not-contaminated-with-poop#:~:text=%22Poo%20found%20on%20every%20McDonald's%20touch%20screen%20tested.%22&text=No%2C%20there%20is%20no%20poop,live%20in%20soil%20and%20water.) that had an emoji smiling at me. I didn't have to worry about someone getting my order wrong and I could look at the food while I was ordering it (in case I didn't know what chips looked like I suppose). People had been replaced. They had paid for these machines to take over that job.

Machines don't get sick or need to take time off when a friend is in trouble. They make businesses more money. If it was your business, would you do it?

## Auto-Farming 9000
This one sparked a massive debate in the teacher's lounge. I had just completed a lesson with grade 7s on biodiversity and we had discussed fully [automated farms](https://farm.bot/) that didn't need people. Well, lots of people. 

I said it was good and exciting.

Others told me how wrong I was because people were losing jobs. I said, "Would you want to do that job? Baby tied to your back while you spent hours upon hours in the Sun, sick or healthy, picking stuff?"

Of course no one _wants_ to, but that was apparently my millenial mind set of "Be happy with what you do most of the day". How silly of me to have people enjoy their work. 

Before you shout at me, which you should, because it seems like I'm agreeing with companies replacing humans with clinkity-clanks, consider this...

## Tech and Robots Make Life Better
Technology is defined at anything that makes our lives better or easier. If people are losing jobs, then that falls out of the definition. But it's still technology, do you know why?

> Our children must use technology to create more jobs that don't exist yet.

They need to know how to use computers, mobiles, robots and anything else that connects to the internet (IoT) to make everyone's lives better.

> You see, robots cannot replace the morals we strive for our children to attain. We need to give them the best tools to exercise those morals and make everyone's lives better.

## Solve Problems with a Beep Boop
And that's where I land. The whole point of education is [problem solving and understanding](https://homecode.co.za/blog/see-understanding-analogies). [Coding and robotics](https://homecode.co.za/blog/we-dont-need-coding) are the best tools for learning problem solving and making thinking visible so we can see if they actually understand.

That's why HomeCode has these [awesome robotics starter kits](https://homecode.shop) that focus on problem solving. If you get one, they come with a free online course, so you don't have to be an expert. 

Imagine if those people who had been 'replaced' were able to repair those machines, or make more like them? What if we used that extra time to bridge the digital divide? The world is changing, indeed, let's make sure we replace the mundane with valuable jobs and give our children and disadvantaged children the best possible advantage.

And let's let robots help us do it.

I would love to keep chatting about this on [FaceBook](https://facebook.com/homecodegeorge), come add your voice in!
