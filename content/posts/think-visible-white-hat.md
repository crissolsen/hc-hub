## You can have yours and I can have mine.
Doesn't that just sound lovely? We can each have our truth and go on our way, blissful and tolerant. Except that has just imposed a truth statement on someone else. 

> Saying that we can all have our own truth is a statement of truth and consequently self-defeating.

## Who built the fact factory?
What we do know is that there is something external to us that holds and keeps the universe running. Laws aren't written by nothing.

> We don't need students who are alright with not knowing. 

We need our children to have the tools to see what fact and fiction are and how they can discern them. This is a skill that they can improve on and the White Thinking Hat is a brilliant tool for just that.

Don't forget to let us know how you handle source analysis and other ways of finding the facts!
