## Describe it right.
It's so easy to get this one wrong and turn it into a circle map. Try not to because then you're missing out on a vital thinking skill - describing.

> When we describe we're using an array of BLOOMS thinking levels including analysing, evaluating and understanding.

See why this is such a great tool?

## Not just words
I've often heard pre-reader teachers say that this isn't suitable. They're wrong, of course. Remember you can use images. You can write the adjectives yourself. You can make it work because it is such a great way of practising this skill of describing.
