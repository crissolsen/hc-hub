## First things...
Have you asked a learner recently to solve a substantial problem? That jarred look of trepidation and fear is a good starting place. Then, you can offer them the tools to work out the sequence that they need to follow in order to achieve success.

> Wouldn't it be great if our children knew how to do things in the right order?

I would like to be able to improve on that as well!

## Simply Elegant
The flow map really is an elegantly simple thing. You don't need to spend hours teaching it. You can drop it in almost any lesson and it empowers your student(s) to solve problems all by themselves. To decide on the correct order and manner in which to do things.

> It helps to prepare them for when they will need to make more decisions themselves.

How awesome that something so basic can help with that!
