## Advertising to our kids
YouTube is a great tool in education. That’s why I made a [channel](https://youtube.com/c/ChristopherOlsen777). Several times I’ve used a YouTube video in a classroom setting and as soon as the YouTuber says, ‘Like and subscribe and don’t forget to ring that bell’, my class would erupt.

“LIKE IT MR OLSEN!!! SUUUBSCRIIIIIBE!!!”

>We are more likely to be persuaded when we don’t realise we are being… persuaded.

While [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02650487.1999.11104771) shows that the greatest influence on purchasing is from parents, it’s still up to us to ensure that our children aren’t viewing things that are going to mess them up- brain wise.

## Enter Brave Browser

[Brave browser](https://brave.com) is built from the same thing that Chrome is. But it’s better. It automatically blocks [trackers](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/what-is-a-web-tracker/), [third party cookies](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-stop-third-party-tracking-on-health-sites/) and adverts (and yes, all those things sound as scary as they are). You can even support websites using their cryptocurrency.

If you’ve taken one of the homeCode Udemy Courses, like the [Space Explorers Coding Course for Kids](https://www.udemy.com/course/space-explorers-coding-course-for-kids/?referralCode=DE8D3C487174A5BF372D) (give me a shout if you want a discount code, by the way), then you would have seen that I like to use real world articles.

>All that advertising used to make me say, “Ah poop, I can’t pooping use this.”

## What are you doing?
I use Brave whenever I require children, who I am teaching, to obtain information from a pre-approved page. I highly recommend that you do too.

It’s [free to download](https://brave.com), so try it and let me know if it helps!

Are you going to use Brave? Or are you using ad blockers as a Chrome extension? [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is also a great browser for this. Let's chat on the [HomeCode Facebook page](https://facebook.com/hoecodegeorge) :)
