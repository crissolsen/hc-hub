## Dear 2020,
I have heard more curse words said about you than pretty much anything else. Even a curse word dictionary. Because people read a dictionary and often don't say what it says out loud.

Anyways.

You were a year that will be remembered for longer than a generation. A year that locked the world down. 

But in this letter, I don't want to talk about that. I want think about some of the great things that happened because of this year.

## At least 5
1. Families are closer.
2. New types of jobs were created.
3. The world came together to find a cure.
4. We were united against a common enemy and put away some smaller differences.
5. We have a new appreciation for the shared spaces we have.

PS. I can't wait to go back to the beach.
