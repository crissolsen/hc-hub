## I'm in a glass case...
Do you feel like there's no place for emotion in decision making? Tell that to a poet or songwriter! 

Understanding our thinking is a skill that can be developed. When we consider red hat thinking we focus on our emotions and how things make us (and others) feel. We might not be able to easily explain why we feel a certain way, but it is important to acknowledge that certain stimulus produces different results in different people and we won't always know why.

## I feel ya.
Empathy and emotional intelligence make our children happier. We want them to be able to collaborate and see that they might not always have the right view.

As you take a look at the activities found here, consider how you might integrate thinking about feelings into your subjects. There's a great example in the video above.
