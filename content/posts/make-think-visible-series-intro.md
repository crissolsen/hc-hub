## I Think We Should Think
I remember teaching grade 5 learners about photosynthesis and having one of the children (who would generally be considered somewhat disruptive) ask, "Why do we need to know this!?"

That was one of my favourite questions!

Our content should drive thinking skills. We spoke about how we need to know how plants survive so we can better leverage energy, how we need to know for growing food - and better growing food. 

Ultimately, this child had shown me that they were thinking. That led to them learning. 

## Let Them Think!
How do we know that our children are thinking, though? How do we know they truly understand? It can be faked. 

Using thinking routines makes that harder. 

In this series we'll look at many different tools that you can use to drive this. To help our children think about their thinking and, consequently, get better at knowing what thinking they'll use to solve problems that don't even exist yet.
