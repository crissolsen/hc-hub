## Digital Citizenship
You don't need to think to hard to remember a time you noticed someone being a jerk online. Or maybe you were quite rude and feel terrible about it now. Digital Citizenship is considering ourselves as part of an online community that has rights and responsibilities. With law increasingly regulating this space it has become essential for our children to learn these skills.

> What you do online matters.

## Minecraft Kindness

Our lesson began with a [circle map](/blog/think-visible-circle-map) where we got our thinking started on what kindness is and where we learnt about it. Our discussions on where we encountered kindess was primarily centered on Minecraft and gaming. I particularly enjoyed how one learner spoke about sharing Minecraft materials as an act of kindness. This meant that he had already started to process of realising that what we do in the digital space can have the same impact as what is done in reality.

After playing Google's Interland 'Kindness Kingdom', we tried out a Minecraft lesson that had us trying to rebuild a castle. We were told we only have 10 minutes to do so. While were doing this, the Agent would drop messages in the chat that were unkind, such as "Are you really going to build that?" and eventually destroyed our creations. 

Learners got to see that, even though it was in the context of a game, when someone is rude or messes with what we've done online, it's upsetting. 

> When you say something online or do something in the digital space there is another real person on the other side of the screen.

We then started building in a shared world that we are striving to make friendly and helpful to others. We've started building a hospital, library and toilets ðŸ˜€. The club already started to establish that there should be consequences if someone is unkind or tries to break apart what others have made.

## Learnings
Our main outcome was to use Minecraft to learn about how we can spread kindness and good vibes in the shared digital community and it went well. There was a lot of excitement for our first lesson and we're still establishing how we can relate to each other and use this amazing tool to learn specific lessons. 

I always like to learn from learners who have more experience in Minecraft and they love to teach me about it. This is something that we'll leverage more and more!
