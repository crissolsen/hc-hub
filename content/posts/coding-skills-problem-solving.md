## The Bridge That Needs Crossing
A man walked up to a bridge one day. He saw that it was broken. He tried to remember all that he had been taught in school about bridges. He considered the rigid nature of triangles. The strength of the trees around him.

He remembered how the Pyramids were built. How plants photosynthesise. 

Eventually he turned back feeling that the problem was too big to solve all by himself. He needed a teacher to give him a question and a mark.

Then a 10 year old walked up to the same bridge. He'd been taught the process of solving a problem. He had been coding, you see. He understood meaningful shortcuts. Hacking the system. Identifying what the problem is, allowing himself lots of silly ideas and good ideas.

Then, he stepped off the bank of the river and walked across the dry river bed.

10/10.

## But... Come on? 
I know, this is a silly example, but it does point out the main point that I wanted to point out...

> Coding is the best tool to teach the process of problem solving. Not being afraid to think of the wrong way before getting to the best possible right way.

Does that mean that all schooling that doesn't teach this is useless? Well, that's a bit harsh of you to suggest. Even if I suggested it first. But in essence, yes. We need to be teaching our children how to learn anything. Coding does that really well. 

BUT...

## Coding as a Tool
Only when coding is used as a tool in all subjects to solve problems does it really blossom like the beautiful tech-flower that it is. It was when I used coding to teach multiplication (like in this video) that it was crazy effective.

When one of my students (who was in bridging classes) coded an entire demonstration on the importance of recycling and environmental care I knew that coding is gold. 

## Code a Unicorn
So is coding the educational unicorn that it seems to be? No. But it does teach the things that we want our kids to know, do and value better than any other tool that I've used. Not in and of itself. Combining coding with storytelling, with engineering, with algorithms, with art means they learn to learn.

And that's what we want. 

Give it a go by checking out the [HomeCode Space Explorers Coding Course for Kids](https://www.udemy.com/course/space-explorers-coding-course-for-kids/?referralCode=DE8D3C487174A5BF372D) or trying an [Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn) for yourself.

Then let me know your thoughts on Facebook, please! I still want to learn more and I know that we learn better together (something else that I learnt through coding).

Keep exploring!
