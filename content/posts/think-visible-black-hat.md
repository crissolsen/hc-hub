## Negative Nancy
She's the one who makes jobs, by the way. Negative Nancy is the one who sees that the designs and solutions out there aren't perfect. She is the one who creates solutions to problems that no one has even noticed yet. 

> Yes, dear friends, Negative Nancy should be a friend to us all.

## Surely Not I?
Yes, you are not perfect. Although I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that. How excellent it would be if we took a critical look at ourselves (without getting stuck in that negativity) and noticed that we could improve. Our learning could be never ending!

> We could learn to enjoy getting better at stuff!

And then our children and learners would too. 

That'd be awesome!!! This type of skill is practised well with the black thinking hat.
