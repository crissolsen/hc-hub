## Start with Nothing
Imagine someone came up to you and asked you to say everything you know on a topic. You'd feel a bit overwhelmed, right? I would. 

It'd be better to give a tool for putting all your thinking down. That's where the circle map comes in.

## The Right Way
Yes, there is actually a right way of using the circle map. Especially if your focus is on improving the skill of defining in context. Here's the key to the whole thing:

> Don't skip out the context.

Even if your children are little, don't miss it. Help them to develop this skill even if it is challenging at first. 

It'll totally be worth it.
