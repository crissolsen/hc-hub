## Get Your LED Throwie Working
In case you haven't tried it out just yet, you will any of your LEDs (light emitting diodes) and have it's arms squeeze the coin battery. If your LED doesn't light up, try it the other way around.

From here you can use your disc magnet to stick it on metal surfaces or stick your magnetic strip somewhere you'd find helpful and then, with the disc magnet, attach it.
