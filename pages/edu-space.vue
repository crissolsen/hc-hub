        The Education Space is here for learners to explore their interests and
        play while learning. Some of the options they have are building and
        creating stories with Lego (we have about 10 000 pieces), coding robotic
        controllers, collaborating in Minecraft, making stop motion movies and
        seeing what's inside electronics in the breakerspace.
      </div>

        There are also weekly clubs that run throughout the week. Namely, the
        Minecraft Education clubs which takes place on a Monday from
        15:00-16:15, Drama clubs on a Wednesday from 13:00-14:15 (ages 6-9) and

        from 9:30-10:45.

      <h2>Stop Motion Creations</h2>
      <div>
        Each week learners' stop motion creations will be uploaded and available
        here. When you click the link it will take you to a OneDrive folder
        where you can view them and download the relevant video. If the video
        doesn't have a descriptive name then you can preview them in the browser
        before downloading.
